# TowerOfHanoiSolver
A python application to find solutions for Tower of Hanoi  Problem based on BFS algorithm

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks available in source peg to target peg, obeying the following simple rules:

1.Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3.No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

#With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
